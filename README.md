# Python_DAQmx_examples

NI's officially supported DAQmx package, [nidaqmx ](https://github.com/ni/nidaqmx-python), was released in 2017 for Windows only. 
`nidaqmx` wraps the DAQmx C API using `ctypes` and is documented [here](https://nidaqmx-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). 
This repository provides more detailed examples [than those given by NI](https://github.com/ni/nidaqmx-python/tree/master/nidaqmx_examples) and also shows how to couple dynamic plotting with with data acquistion. 
If you wish to use NI's hardware on Linux you can try [PyDAQmx](https://pythonhosted.org/PyDAQmx/index.html). 


## Installation
Install the API, then you can play with the examples.
```
pip install nidaqmx
```
